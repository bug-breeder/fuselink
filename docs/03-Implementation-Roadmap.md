# Implementation Roadmap

## âœ… Phase 1: Foundation (Complete)
- [x] Vite + React + TypeScript setup with Vitest testing
- [x] Origin UI components integration (58+ components)
- [x] Tailwind v4 configuration with proper CSS variables
- [x] Zustand state management with persistence middleware
- [x] libp2p WebRTC node setup and initialization
- [x] Comprehensive test suite (63 tests passing)

## âœ… Phase 2: Device Identity & Pairing (Complete)
- [x] Web Crypto ECDH keypair generation (P-256 curve)
- [x] Device ID derivation from public key hash
- [x] QR code generation with pairing data and multiaddr
- [x] QR scanning with BarcodeDetector API + fallback library
- [x] Safety words fingerprint verification (BIP-39 subset)
- [x] Persistent device store with localStorage
- [x] Trusted device management and recognition
- [x] Complete pairing UI flow with progress indicators
- [x] Device management interface (rename, remove, status)

## ðŸ”„ Phase 3: WebRTC Connection (In Progress)
- [x] Enhanced ICE servers with multiple Google STUN endpoints
- [x] libp2p multiaddr integration in QR codes
- [ ] libp2p WebRTC peer connection establishment
- [ ] DataChannel establishment with TURN fallback
- [ ] Connection health monitoring and reconnection

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 4: File Transfer (Planned)
- [ ] End-to-end encryption (per-session key exchange)
- [ ] File chunking with resumable transfers
- [ ] Transfer progress tracking and cancellation
- [ ] Integrity verification with chunk-level checksums

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 5: Folder Sync & Polish (Planned)
- [ ] Folder mapping interface with include/exclude patterns
- [ ] File system watching and diff calculation
- [ ] Push notifications to trigger sync requests
- [ ] Cross-browser testing and UX improvements

## Current Status
âœ… **Devices can now maintain persistent identities**
âœ… **Complete pairing flow with device recognition**
âœ… **No re-pairing required across app restarts**
âœ… **Comprehensive test coverage and UI components**

## Success Criteria
- [x] Two devices can pair via QR code with safety words
- [x] Devices remember each other across app restarts
- [x] Robust UI with proper error handling
- [ ] Files transfer directly between devices (next milestone)
- [ ] All data is end-to-end encrypted
- [ ] Works across different networks (TURN fallback)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Device Identity System
- **ECDH P-256 Keypairs**: Generated using Web Crypto API for each device
- **Device IDs**: SHA-256 hash of public key (first 16 hex chars for display)
- **Persistence**: Public key + device metadata in localStorage (private key in memory only)
- **Safety Words**: BIP-39 subset (128 words) for device fingerprint verification

### Pairing Flow
1. **QR Generation**: Device info + libp2p multiaddr + timestamp (10min expiry)
2. **QR Scanning**: BarcodeDetector API with @zxing/library fallback
3. **Device Recognition**: Skip verification for previously trusted devices
4. **Safety Words**: Side-by-side verification for new device pairing
5. **Trust Storage**: Persistent trusted device list with pairing status

### Testing Infrastructure
- **63 Tests Passing**: Comprehensive coverage for crypto, QR, and device store
- **Vitest + jsdom**: Modern testing with Web Crypto API mocking
- **@testing-library/react**: Component testing with user interactions
- **CI-Ready**: All tests pass consistently
