# Fuselink - P2P File Sync

## Overview
Peer-to-peer file synchronization with WebRTC and end-to-end encryption. Currently in planning phase.

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Origin UI + Tailwind
- **Backend**: Supabase (Database + Auth + Push notifications)
- **P2P**: libp2p (handles WebRTC + signaling + NAT traversal automatically)
- **Security**: libp2p Noise protocol + application layer encryption

## Project Structure (To Be Created)
```
/app               # React PWA (not created yet)
/docs              # Project documentation
```

## Quick Commands (When Implemented)
```bash
# Frontend only (Supabase handles backend)
cd app && yarn dev
```

## Development Guidelines
- **Don't reinvent the wheel** - use proven libraries (libp2p, Supabase, Origin UI)
- **Keep it simple** - choose the path with least custom code
- **Test-driven development** - write tests alongside implementation to ensure everything works out of the box
- **Update docs as you implement** - but keep them short and concise, avoid over-documentation
- Use **yarn** for frontend package management
- Use **Origin UI** components (copy-paste from originui.com)
- Use **libp2p** instead of manual WebRTC (eliminates 500+ lines of signaling code)
- Use feature branches + PRs (never push to main)
- HTTPS required for Web Crypto API

## Key Features (Planned)
1. QR code device pairing (libp2p multiaddrs)
2. Direct P2P transfers (libp2p WebRTC transport)
3. End-to-end encryption (libp2p Noise + app layer)
4. Push notifications for sync requests (Supabase)
5. Progressive Web App

## Architecture Philosophy
- **Avoid custom implementations** - use battle-tested libraries
- **libp2p eliminates** WebRTC signaling complexity (500+ lines â†’ 50 lines)
- **Supabase eliminates** backend server code
- **Origin UI eliminates** custom component development
- **Focus on business logic** rather than infrastructure

## Documentation Philosophy
- **Update docs alongside code** - don't let them get stale
- **Keep documentation minimal** - short, concise, actionable
- **Avoid over-documentation** - focus on what developers actually need
- **Code should be self-documenting** - clear naming and structure over lengthy comments

## Testing Philosophy
- **Test everything** - write tests alongside implementation (TDD approach)
- **Ensure everything works out of the box** - no broken functionality should reach main
- **Test components individually** - unit tests for each UI component and function
- **Test integration** - verify libp2p, Supabase, and UI components work together
- **Create test pages** - `/test` routes to manually verify functionality during development

## Current Status
âœ… **Phase 1 Complete** - Foundation implemented and tested
ðŸš€ **Running**: http://localhost:5173 (dev server)
ðŸ§ª **Test page**: http://localhost:5173/test (component validation)
ðŸ”„ **Next**: Phase 2 - Device Pairing (QR generation & scanning)
